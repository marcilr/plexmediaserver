Looks good.

3. "Linux packages for Plex Media Player

There are two packaging formats available. AppImage and Flatpak.
Both aim to be universal and distribution agnostic.

AppImage is supported for a long time now, however there are known 
problems with it like “sign in” button working only in fullscreen 
mode. If having issues give Flatpak a try."

...


"AppImage

No need to install. No root required. Download the AppImage file,
make it executable, and double click to start the application.
It is as simple as that.

Works on all modern Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Mint, 
Fedora, Arch, Debian and others.
